ABSTRACT

The slogan “nobody is safe until everybody is safe” is a dictum to raise awareness that in an interconnected world,
pandemics such as COVID-19, require a global approach. Motivated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we model
here the spread of a virus in interconnected communities and explore different vaccination scenarios, assuming that
the efficacy of the vaccination wanes over time. We start with susceptible populations and consider a susceptible-
vaccinated-infected-recovered model with unvaccinated (“Bronze”), moderately vaccinated (“Silver”) and very well
vaccinated (“Gold”) communities, connected through different types of networks via a diffusive linear coupling for
local spreading. We show that when considering interactions in “Bronze”-“Gold” and “Bronze”-“Silver” communities,
the “Bronze” community is driving an increase in infections in the “Silver” and “Gold” communities. This shows a
detrimental, unidirectional effect of non-vaccinated to vaccinated communities. Regarding the interactions between
“Gold”, “Silver” and “Bronze” communities in a network, we find that two factors play central role: the coupling
strength in the dynamics and network density. When considering the spread of a virus in Barabási-Albert networks,
infections in “Silver” and “Gold” communities are lower than in “Bronze” communities. We find that the “Gold”
communities are the best in keeping their infection levels low. However, a small number of “Bronze” communities are
enough to give rise to an increase in infections in moderately and well-vaccinated communities. When studying the
spread of a virus in a dense Erdős-Rényi, and sparse Watts-Strogatz and Barabási-Albert networks, the communities
reach the disease-free state in the dense Erdős-Rényi networks, but not in the sparse Watts-Strogatz and Barabási-Albert
networks. However, we also find that if all these networks are dense enough, all types of communities reach the disease-
free state. We conclude that the presence of a few unvaccinated or partially vaccinated communities in a network, can
increase significantly the rate of infected population in other communities. This reveals the necessity of a global effort
to facilitate access to vaccines for all communities.
